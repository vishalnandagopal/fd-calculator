A simple website I made because the existing online calculators weren't that good. Design (color scheme only) partially inspired by [Groww](https://groww.in/calculators/fd-calculator) & [fd-calculator.in](https://fd-calculator.in/). They also had annoying minimum investment stuff, and wouldn't allow exorbitant values in the returns field. The main point of using such online calculators is to find out what would be the value in case the exorbitant returns happened with you, so existing calculators felt pretty lacking.
